			"2": "In the opinion of the Norwegian Directorate of Health, from an educational perspective, meals are a basic factor to promote concentration and learning*. In their guidelines, they recommend that the school meal every day should consist of milk, bread and cereal products and vegetables, fruit or berries.",
			"3": "The Norwegian Directorate of Health recommend that the school meal should contain skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, combined with bread and some fruit. If you are not fond of drinking milk, you can eat yogurt or cheese. It may then be good to know that there is about as much calcium in one glass of milk as in one cup of yoghurt or two thick slices of cheese.",
